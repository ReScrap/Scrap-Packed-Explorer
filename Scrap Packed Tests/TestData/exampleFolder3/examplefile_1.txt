Ok! This file is in exampleFolder3 and called examplefile_1.txt ...
This is just some example file.
But i want to make this file even bigger than exampleFolder2/examplefile_1.txt ...
The reason is similar to what we had for the other file.
Because it might make sense if we replace a file with a bigger one to test that.
If we add exampleFolder1 first then exampleFolder2 that one will replace the one from exampleFolder1.
And now if we then add exampleFolder3 this one will replace the one from exampleFolder2.
The file content isn't really relevant.
