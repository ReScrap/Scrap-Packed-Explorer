Hm... this file is in exampleFolder2 and called examplefile_1...
This is just some example file.
But i want to make this file bigger than exampleFolder1/examplefile_1.txt ...
Because it might make sense if we replace a file with a bigger one to test that.
If we add exampleFolder1 first then exampleFolder2 this will replace the one from exampleFolder1.
The file content isn't really relevant.
