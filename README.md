Scrap Packed Explorer
=====================

With this App it is planned to make it userfriendly to create a new or modify the contents of an existing .packed file for the Game Scrapland.

See also the [Scrap Hacks Project by Earthnuker](https://gitdab.com/Earthnuker/ScrapHacks) (on gitdab)  
There is already a CLI implementation to modify packed files using Python (3.5 ?)

## Todo (not strictly ordered by priority)
- [x] Create Project structure
- Command Line Interface
	- [x] mostly done, see issue [#1](/../../issues/1)
- Graphical User Interface _(see also issue [#2](/../../issues/2))_
	- [x] directory tree
	- [x] folder content view
	- [x] add file/folder
	- [ ] replace warning
	- [x] remove file/folder
	- [x] extract file/folder
	- [ ] rename file/folder
	- [ ] search name
	- [ ] search content (maybe)
	- [ ] drag & drop
	- [ ] drag & drop between 2 packed (maybe)
	- [ ] icon
	- [ ] nice loading animation
	- [ ] direct vs prepare modes
    	_Re-create archive on each change or prepare changes and then save_
	- [ ] "modding" mode (maybe)
    	_Have huge gaps between files edited to not move around bits much inside archive while constantly editing_
	- [ ] file preview (maybe)
- Misc: see [other issues](/../../issues/)
